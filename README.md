# ari-py

This is a somewhat simple script that I did for making a call in asterisk via ari-py. I haven't scourged the internet to find some
more tutorial, but if nothing is changed much from the last time I created this script (which is last year), then I guess there's little
to none on how to use this F U N stuff. So here it is, for now, I will just copy paste and modify the main.py a bit.

When I have the time, I'll test it and make sure it work, but for now, you can either use this as your example or just fork it and 
make your own
